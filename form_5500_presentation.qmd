## Executive Summary

**Overview**

- Analysis of ~420K companies with ERISA Form 5500 filing data (sample)
- Covers years 2020-2024 with historical data
- Data source: Department of Labor Form 5500 filings

**Key Findings**

- Peak filing year: 2023 with **146,403 companies** (raw data)
- 83% of companies have fewer than 50 enrolled employees
- Top industries: Healthcare, Professional Services, Construction
- Top Brokers: USI, Gallagher, Lockton, Marsh & McLennan
- Welfare plans: 73,677 | Pension plans: 421,818

**Speaker Notes:**

This presentation covers our exploratory data analysis of Form 5500 filings - the primary regulatory filings for employee benefit plans in the US. This data is foundational for our company clustering and benefits insurance scoring initiative. The analysis reveals a highly fragmented market dominated by small businesses, with significant consolidation among brokers and carriers.

## Question 1: How Many Companies File Each Year?

### Filing Trends (2020-2024)

| Year | Companies Filing |
|------|-----------------|
| 2020 | 156,805 |
| 2021 | 155,304 |
| 2022 | 155,289 |
| 2023 | 146,403 |
| 2024 | 126,620 |

![Companies Filing by Year](plots/companies_filing_by_year.png)

### Key Observations

- **Stable volumes**: ~150K companies file annually (2020-2023)
- **2024 decline**: Likely due to incomplete data for latest year
- **500K filings sample** analyzed for detailed attributes

**Speaker Notes:**

This chart shows Form 5500 filings over time using raw data files for accurate company counts. The volumes have been relatively stable around 150K companies per year. The decline in 2024 likely reflects incomplete data collection rather than an actual market decrease.

## Question 2: Size Range by Enrolled Employees

### Distribution Statistics

- **Median**: 11 enrolled employees
- **Mean**: 183 employees
- **25th percentile**: 3 employees
- **75th percentile**: 35 employees

### Size Bin Distribution

| Size Range | Filings | Percentage |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| 0 (No Participants) | 72,793 | 14.6% |
| 1-10 (Micro) | 175,647 | 35.1% |
| 11-50 (Small) | 155,233 | 31.0% |
| 51-100 (Small-Medium) | 41,515 | 8.3% |
| 101-500 (Medium) | 39,476 | 7.9% |
| 501-1000 (Medium-Large) | 6,506 | 1.3% |
| 1001-5000 (Large) | 6,504 | 1.3% |
| 5000+ (Enterprise) | 2,326 | 0.5% |

![Size Distribution](plots/size_distribution.png)

**Speaker Notes:**

This slide reveals a critically important insight: the benefits market is overwhelmingly composed of small businesses. Over half of all companies filing Form 5500 have 10 or fewer employees. This skew has major implications for our clustering and scoring models.

## Data Quality Notes

### Known Issues

1. **Missing NAICS**: Many companies show "Unknown" for industry
2. **Name standardization**: Broker/carrier names need deduplication
3. **Outlier detection**: Some premium values appear incorrect
4. **2024 data**: May be incomplete due to reporting delays

### Data Processing Applied

- Successfully handled numpy array format in year columns
- Created safe type conversions for NAICS codes
- Added error handling for empty data visualizations

**Speaker Notes:**

We identified several data quality issues:
1. NAICS mapping gaps exist in the processed data
2. Name deduplication is critical for accurate broker/carrier analysis
3. Some premium outliers need investigation

## Clustering Model Recommendations

### Recommended Algorithms

1. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Best for: Initial segmentation with spherical clusters
   - Features: Company size, carrier count, product types

2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Best for: Industry-specific groupings
   - Reveals nested relationships in NAICS codes

3. **DBSCAN**
   - Best for: Finding natural clusters and outliers
   - Identifies unusual benefits profiles

4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
   - Best for: Probabilistic cluster assignments
   - Companies can belong to multiple segments

**Speaker Notes:**

Based on our EDA, here's our recommended clustering approach:
- K-Means is starting point - interpretable, works well for size-based segments
- GMM recommended for production because benefits programs aren't mutually exclusive

---

## Key Features for Clustering

### Size Features
- `total_all_participants` - Plan participant count
- `benefits_eligible` - Employees eligible for benefits
- Plan size category (small/large)

### Industry Features
- NAICS sector (first 2 digits)
- NAICS subsector (first 3 digits)
- Multi-sector indicator

### Benefits Program Features
- Number of unique carriers
- Number of unique brokers
- Product types (health, dental, vision, life, etc.)
- Welfare vs pension indicators
- Total premiums

### Geographic Features
- State/region

---

## Recommendations & Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Feature Engineering**: Create binary indicators for each product type
2. **Feature Scaling**: Normalize participant counts and premium values
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Consider PCA if features are correlated

### Validation

- Use silhouette score to determine optimal cluster count
- Elbow method for K-Means
- Cross-validate across time periods

### Scoring Model

- Once clusters defined, score each company
- Consider: benefits complexity, premium levels, carrier quality
- Build predictive model for benefits needs

**Speaker Notes:**

Our immediate next steps:
1. Feature engineering: Transform raw data into cluster-friendly features
2. Validation: Determine how many clusters make business sense
3. Scoring: After clustering, assign "benefits sophistication scores"
